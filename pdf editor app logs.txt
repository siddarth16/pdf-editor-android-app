In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval.

MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.

2025-07-06T00:39:18.0313378Z The Kotlin Gradle plugin was loaded multiple times in different subprojects, which is not supported and may break the build. 
2025-07-06T00:39:18.0315978Z This might happen in subprojects that apply the Kotlin plugins with the Gradle 'plugins { ... }' DSL if they specify explicit versions, even if the versions are equal.
2025-07-06T00:39:18.0339287Z Please add the Kotlin plugin to the common parent project or the root project, then remove the versions in the subprojects.
2025-07-06T00:39:18.0346451Z If the parent project does not need the plugin, add 'apply false' to the plugin line.
