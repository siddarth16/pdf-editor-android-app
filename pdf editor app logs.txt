With the exception of MIPS’ rights to enforce its intellectual property rights and any confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, all disputes and any claims arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California.

2025-07-06T00:10:49.6037055Z 
2025-07-06T00:10:49.6038941Z 10.2 Remedies. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any breach of confidentiality obligations under this Agreement or any licenses distributed with the Evaluation Materials, as well as any disclosure, commercialization, or public use of the Evaluation Materials, would cause irreparable injury to MIPS, and therefore Recipient agrees to consent to, and hereby consents to, the grant of an injunction by any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of an actual or threatened breach.
2025-07-06T00:10:49.6040436Z

In the event that any provision of this Agreement is finally adjudicated to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such unenforceable or invalid provision shall be interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within the limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions.

Recipient shall not export, either directly or indirectly, any product, service or technical data or system incorporating the Evaluation Materials without first obtaining any required license or other necessary approval from the U.S. Department of Commerce or any other governing agency or department of the United States Government. In the event any product is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by Recipient, Recipient shall ensure that the distribution and export/re-export or import of the product is in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. Recipient agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries will export/re-export any technical data, process, product, or service, directly or indirectly, to any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such license or approval. Recipient also agrees to implement measures to ensure that foreign national employees are authorized to receive any information controlled by U.S. export control laws.

2025-07-06T00:10:49.6065477Z 10.7 Special Terms for Pre-Release Materials. If so indicated in the description of the Evaluation Software, the Evaluation Software may contain Pre-Release Materials. Recipient hereby understands, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Pre-Release Materials may not be fully tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) Pre-Release materials are not suitable for commercial release in their current state; (iii) regulatory approvals for Pre-Release Materials (such as UL or FCC) have not been obtained, and Pre-Release Materials may therefore not be certified for use in certain countries or environments or may not be suitable for certain applications and (iv) MIPS can provide no assurance that it will ever produce or make generally available a production version of the Pre-Release Materials . MIPS is not under any obligation to develop and/or release or offer for sale or license a final product based upon the Pre-Release Materials and may unilaterally elect to abandon the Pre-Release Materials or any such development platform at any time and without any obligation or liability whatsoever to Recipient or any other person.
